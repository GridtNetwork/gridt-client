We’re developing a non-profit, open source social application that inspires discipline, leadership and ‘grit’ in its users. The Gridt is designed as a new type of network that connects social movements.

Gridt-client is the frontend for the [Gridt](https://gridt.org) application. The backend can be found on our [server repository](https://github.com/GridtNetwork/gridt-server).

## Prerequisites
This application is built with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) which is a framework to build cross platform applications. It comes with regular Angular installations, which are installed using the following commands.

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
sudo npm i @angular-devkit/build-angular
sudo npm i @angular/core
sudo npm i @angular/router
sudo npm i @ionic/angular
sudo npm i @ionic-native/splash-screen
sudo npm i @capacitor/core
sudo npm i @ionic-native/status-bar
sudo npm i @angular/service-worker
sudo npm i @ionic/pwa-elements
sudo npm i capacitor-secure-storage-plugin
sudo npm i @angular/platform-browser-dynamic
```

## Installation
Clone the repository and move into it. If NodeJS and Angular are properly set up (see prerequisites) then Ionic is ready to serve.

Run:
```
cd gridt
sudo npm install
ionic serve
```

A browser window should automatically pop-up and redirect you to the website.
