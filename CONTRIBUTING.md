# Contributing

We from The Gridt Project love to welcome anyone who wants to contribute to the project.
In this document we get you up to speed to start making your first commits!

## Project leaders
Our lead developer is [@Drvanon](https://github.com/Drvanon). He is a nice guy so don't be shy to ask him in depth questions about the code. If you plan on making contributions, feel free to also approach [@Yori-O92](https://github.com/Yori-O92) our CEO.

## Coding sessions
Every Tuesday we host a coding session on Google Meet. During these meetings we evaluate our progress and discuss future developments. Contact [@marickmanrho](https://github.com/marickmanrho) if you'd like to join us.

## How to start
Here's how to get involved:
- Visit our website http://www.gridt.org
- Take a quick look at the [api-development branch](https://github.com/GridtNetwork/gridt-client/tree/api-development)
- Check out our [CODE OF CONDUCT](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Contact [@marickmanrho](https://github.com/marickmanrho) to be added to our Slack and to be invited to our coding sessions.
- Contact [@Drvanon](https://github.com/Drvanon) for guidance on picking your first issue
- Clone the [gridt-server](https://github.com/GridtNetwork/gridt-server) and set it up on your local machine
- Clone the [gridt-client](https://github.com/GridtNetwork/gridt-client)
- Take a look at the Ionic documentation

## The contributing process
There are 3 levels at which contribution is possible:

1. Documentation/Issue generation
2. Testing
3. Features

### Documentation
Before you actually start to code, it might be very useful for you to help us expand our documentation. We go through a lot of effort to document our code as well as possible, but there is always more that you could do. Feel free to ask questions about subjects you don't understand yet. Once you know the answer, please write it down so that the awesome coders after you don't have to do the same thing!

Gridt works with a simplified version of agile development. We create issues with titles in the shape of a user story. "As a `<user>` I want `<a feature>` for `<a reason>`." We then label it with a milestone to set a date for when we want to have dealt with the subject and enter it in a project to show our co-contributors what we are working on.

If you want to report a bug, you can also do that. Please be as explicit as possible. Tell us what behaviour you observed and what you expected. You can even suggest a rough fix if you'd like to!

### Testing
Once you have a proper understanding of our code, we would really appreciate it if you could assist us with writing tests for our platform. We have laid the fundaments for this, but there is a lot of tests that still can be of much use. Any addittion will be very welcome.

### Writing Features
Once you think you really understand the server and all of it's intricacies, you can start to write some additional functionalities. You can request to have an issue assigned to you and we will check your pull requests as quickly as possible!

If you have write access to the repository, make sure you are up to date with origin (`git pull origin api-development`) and then create a new branch (`git branch Issue-#`), that you checkout (`git checkout Issue-#`). Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m "<YOUR MESSAGE HERE>"`), please write a descriptive commit message. Then publish your changes (`git push origin Issue-#`) and go to github to create a new pull-request.
