# Contributing

We from The Gridt Project love to welcome anyone who wants to contribute to the project.
In this document we get you up to speed to start making your first commits!

## Project leaders
Our Chief Technology Officer is [@ddvduuren](https://github.com/ddvduuren). He is the one to contact if you want to be part our Gridt Slack. 
Our lead developer is [@Drvanon](https://github.com/Drvanon). He is a nice guy so don't be shy to ask him in depth questions about the code.

## Coding sessions
Most of us are from Groningen, The Netherlands. Hence, every wednesday we host a coding session at the Zernike campus of the University of Groningen.

Adress: *Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG, Groningen*

Date: *Every Wednesday (not during holidays)*

Time: *17:00 - 19:00*

Important to note, every first Wednesday of the month there is free pizza during the coding session! You don't have to reserve a seat, just meet us there.

## The contributing process
There are 3 levels at which contribution is possible:

1. Documentation/Issue generation
2. Testing
3. Features

### Documentation
Before you actually start to code, it might be very useful for you to help us expand our documentation. We go through a lot of effort to document our code as well as possible, but there is always more that you could do. Feel free to ask questions about subjects you don't understand yet. Once you know the answer, please write it down so that the awesome coders after you don't have to do the same thing!

Gridt works with a simplified version of agile development. We create issues with titles in the shape of a user story. "As a <user> I want <a feature> for <a reason>." We then label it with a milestone to set a date for when we want to have dealt with the subject and enter it in a project to show our co-contributors what we are working on. 
  
If you want to report a bug, you can also do that. Please be as explicit as possible. Tell us what behaviour you observed and what you expected. You can even suggest a rough fix if you'd like to!

### Testing
Once you have a proper understanding of our code, we would really appreciate it if you could assist us with writing tests for our platform. We have laid the fundaments for this, but there is a lot of tests that still can be of much use. Any addittion will be very welcome.

### Writing Features
Once you think you really understand the server and all of it's intricacies, you can start to write some additional functionalities. You can request to have an issue assigned to you and we will check your pull requests as quickly as possible!
